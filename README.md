# gitaip: AI-Assisted Git Workflow Automation

gitaip is a powerful Git macro that streamlines your development workflow by automatically generating:
- Branch names (semantic and descriptive)
- Commit messages (conventional commits)
- Pull Request descriptions (with optional structured templates)

All powered by the OpenAI API, tuned for software development productivity.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Setup Script

```bash
./start.sh
```

You will be prompted to:
- Provide your OpenAI API key
- Optionally store it in the macOS Keychain (if on macOS)
- Register the gitaip command in your shell (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc)

💡 **After setup, reload your shell:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc depending on your shell
```

### 2. Usage

```bash
git add . # or stage files manually
gitaip
```

The script will:
- Detect staged changes or auto-stage modified files
- Prompt OpenAI to generate a branch name, commit message, and PR body
- Ask you to approve or refine them
- Create the branch, commit, push, and open a GitHub PR

## 🧠 Features

### ✅ Semantic Commit Message and Branch Naming
- Uses the diff (or changed files/functions if diff too large) to generate:
  - `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, etc.
  - `feat/add-validation`, `refactor/restructure-api`, etc.

### ✅ PR Creation with AI-Generated Descriptions
- Uses the GitHub CLI to create PRs
- Option to use an advanced PR template with sections like:
  - Issue being fixed
  - What was done
  - How it was tested
  - Breaking changes
  - Checklist

### ✅ Interactive Feedback Loop
- Don't like the suggestion? Provide feedback, and the AI will regenerate

### ✅ Merge Conflict Safety
- Detects unresolved conflicts and exits cleanly

### ✅ Configurable Defaults
- Remembers template preferences via `.gitaipconfig`
- Adds `.gitaipconfig` to `.gitignore` automatically

## Breaking Changes
None

## Checklist:
- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [x] I have added or updated relevant unit/integration/functional/e2e tests
- [ ] I have assigned this pull request to a milestone
```

---

## 🛠 Requirements
- `jq`
- `curl`
- `git`
- `gh` (GitHub CLI)

---

## 🔐 API Key Security
- **macOS**: Securely stored in Keychain
- **Other systems**: Stored in .bashrc/.zshrc with `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...`

---

## 🧪 Testing

You can simulate a run by staging some changes and running:

```bash
gitaip
```

Try changing a function, committing, and letting the AI generate the branch and PR.

---

## 🧹 Uninstalling

To remove the alias and API key:

```bash
# Remove alias and key from your shell config
nano ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc

# If stored in macOS Keychain
security delete-generic-password -s OPENAI_API_KEY -a $USER
```
